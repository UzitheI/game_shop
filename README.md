# Uzi's Game Shop

Welcome to **Uzi's Game Shop**! This project is a fun and simple game listing app built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Axios. Its primary aim is to explore and test various front-end technologies, particularly API integration with Axios. The games shown on this site are fetched from the **RAWG API**.

Although the data displayed might not be the most up-to-date, this project provides a great opportunity to explore how React components work, how Tailwind CSS can simplify styling, and how to make API calls in a clean and efficient way.

Feel free to explore and try out the site!
