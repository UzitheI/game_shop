<h1><b>GAME SHOP</b></h1>

<p>The game shop is not a product of any kind but a project primarily aimed to test some React, TailwindCSS and API calls using Axios. The games or data shown in the game may not be relevant as RAWGAPI gamelist that has been fetched here has not seen any changes for quite a while. Hope you give my site a try. </p>
